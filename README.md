##  Installation

```
# Clone dotfiles repo
git clone https://github.com/TheArqsz/dotfiles.git $HOME/.dotfiles

# Go to the dotfiles directory
cd $HOME/.dotfiles

# Install dotfiles
./install
```

##  Updating

Use single command to get latest updates:

`update`

This command will update dotfiles, [c4p](https://github.com/TheArqsz/containers4pentesters) (if installed), brew, apt-get packages and zinit plugins.

##  What exactly is it?

The main part of this project is `.zshrc` file which contains the main configuration. I will describe briefly the details below:

###  Zinit and plugins

The main plugin manager for my zsh shell is [zinit](https://github.com/zdharma-continuum/zinit). 

I am using some Zinit's native plugins but also some from OhMyZSH (with prefix `OMZP` or `OMZL`):

- zsh-hooks/zsh-hooks 
- zsh-users/zsh-autosuggestions 
- zsh-users/zsh-completions
- Aloxaf/fzf-tab
- OMZL::clipboard.zsh 
- OMZP::copyfile 
- OMZP::systemd 
- OMZP::pip 
- OMZP::eza 
- OMZP::tldr 
- OMZP::command-not-found

###  Prompt

As for the prompt, I am using the highly customizable [Spaceship](https://spaceship-prompt.sh/) with following sections:
- user            - Username section
- host            - Hostname section
- ip              - [Custom IP section](TheArqsz/spaceship-ip)
- dir             - Current directory section
- git             - Git section (git_branch + git_status)
- package         - Package version
- docker_compose  - Docker section
- ansible         - Ansible section
- venv            - virtualenv section
- exit_code       - Exit code section
- exec_time       - Execution time
- line_sep        - Line break
- sudo            - Sudo indicator
- char            - Prompt character

I've also written a few shell functions that allow me to modify the prompt on the fly:
- [switch_prompt_ip](./files/.functions#switch_prompt_ip)
- [switch_prompt_hostname](./files/.functions#switch_prompt_hostname)

###  Automatic installation of additional software

For my zsh to be as noninteractive to be set up as possible I made it to install a few tools automatically at the first shell boot. It sets up:

- **pyenv** with 3.11.9 as a py main version (fallback to 3.10.7)
- auto **tmux** at the ssh connection
- **fzf** (to make listings more interactive)

###  Custom key bindings (additional to Emacs)

- `Ctrl+Up` - backword history search
- `Ctrl+Down` - forward history search
- `Ctrl+Right` - forward word
- `Ctrl+Left` - backward word
- `Alt+Right` - forward word (with inclusion of `/` as a delimiter)
- `Alt+Left` - backward word (with inclusion of `/` as a delimiter)
- `Alt+Backspace` - backward delete word
- `Alt+Delete` - forward delete word

---

- `Esc+T` - execute `tldr` for a typed command (you have to type command first)
- `Start+V` - if `copyq` is installed, show the clipboard history

###  Additional changes

- Terminal history extended to 100000
- Duplicates erased from the history
- Keep history between the shell instances (terminals)
- Append to the history immidiately (not after the term is killed)
- Ignore entries in history that start with space
- Timestamps are recorded in history
- Name of a directory can be used instead of `cd dirname`

---

- Auto update for `brew` is installed to be done only once a week
- `Brew` is set to not send analytics
- `Brew` is set to not use emojis

---

- If `Go` is installed, set proper envs

---

- If [c4p](https://github.com/TheArqsz/containers4pentesters) is installed, set proper envs

### Aliases

- `ls`=`eza --color=auto --group-directories-first`
- `l`=`ls -lhF`
- `la`=`ls -lhAF`
- `tree`=`ls --tree`

> fd

- `find`=`fd`

- `fd`=`fdfind`

> grep: color and show the line number for each match

- `grep`=`grep -n --color` 

> Enable aliases to be sudoâ€™ed

- `sudo`=```sudo [space]```

- `bootstrap`=`zsh $DOTFILES/scripts/bootstrap.sh`
- `btsp`=`zsh $DOTFILES/scripts/bootstrap.sh`
- `bootstrap.sh`=`zsh $DOTFILES/scripts/bootstrap.sh`

##  Bootstraping

If you want to automate the installation of a few tools, I got you covered. I implemented some functions that can do that for you. It can be found at the `bootstrap` or `bootstrap.sh` or `btsp` aliases:

```zsh
$ bootstrap -h
Usage: bootstrap -t tool...
Bootstrap OS and/or tools

Optional arguments:
    -t, --tool             Bootstrap specific tool (default: none, can be set to "all" or "gui")
        all:    Install all CLI tools
        gui:    Install additional GUI-based tools (Signal, Brave, Burp Suite Pro)

        tool1,tool2:    You can specify a few tools separated by a comma

    -l, --list-tools       List tools to be bootstrapped
    -s, --system           Bootstrap system
    -v, --verbose          Set verbose mode

    --code-extensions      Additional VSCode extensions to install
    --list-default-ext     List default VSCode extensions
```

Current list of basic tools:

```zsh
brew
code
copyq
docker
eza
fdfind
fzf
golang
obsidian
pyenv
tmux
updog
```

Additionaly, I prepared 3 additional `categories`:

```zsh
all
c4p
gui
```

Each of the given tools or categories may be installed with:

```zsh
$ bootstrap -l copyq
```

or 

```zsh
$ bootstrap -l copyq,docker,eza
```

###  Categories

- `all` - it will install all the basic tools listed above
- `c4p` - it will install the [c4p](https://github.com/TheArqsz/containers4pentesters) project
- `gui` - it will install GUI tools, such as:
    - `brave`
    - `burp suite`
    - `signal`
    - `flameshot`

###  Additional information on tools
